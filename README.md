I'm a junior fullstack developer in training until November 2025.  
I like building responsive interfaces with Vue.js, and I also enjoy working with Java and Spring Boot.

I like to plan about how to build UI: atomic design, structure, and not leaving anyone out.
Writing code that makes sense â€” for everyone!

#### Now I
- Learning and building with Vue.js, Java, Spring Boot and PostgreSQL  
- Continue my music ads platform I started
- Looking for my first dev job (CDI or POEI)

#### A bit about me
Originally, I studied Communication Design â€“ Space and Volume.   
Today I bring that sense of structure and real-world logic into the way I code.
