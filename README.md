## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Three years ago, someone gave me a book about HTML/CSS.  Thatâ€™s the moment that made me want to understand the web.

Now, Iâ€™m completing a work-study program for a diploma in Software Design and Development (France).

My favorite stack is Vue.js, Java Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL.

I'm very interested in UI design (design system, accessibility) and server-side code structure to structure my projects from start to finish. 

#### Currently, I'll:
- Finalize my music platform project (tests, GDPR compliance, mp3 format upload)
- Learn more about Spring Security and integration testing
- Look for my first full-time developer job
---
#### About 
A former communications designer, specializing in space and volume, I have retained a taste for cleanliness, logic, and functionality.

Today, I bring that into my code.
