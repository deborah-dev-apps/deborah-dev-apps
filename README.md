## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Three years ago, someone gave me a book about HTML/CSS.  Thatâ€™s the moment that made me want to understand the web.

Today, I'm working on a work-study program for the Software Design and Development diploma (France).

My favorite stack is Vue.js, Java Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL.

I'm very interested in UI design (design system, accessibility) and server-side code structure to structure my projects from start to finish. 

#### Currently (until November 2025), I'll:
- Finalize my music platform project (auth, interface, mp3 format upload)
- Learn more about Spring Security and integration testing
- Look for my first permanent full-time dev job
---
#### About 
A former communications designer, specializing in space and volume, I have retained a taste for cleanliness, logic, and functionality.

Today, I put that into my code.
